        <h1>Plot</h1>
        <p> In Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, Albus Dumbledore learns that Gellert Grindelwald, the powerful dark wizard, is plotting to seize control of the wizarding world by influencing an upcoming election. However, due to a blood pact made in their youth, Dumbledore is unable to directly confront Grindelwald. Instead, he assembles a team to stop him, led by Magizoologist Newt Scamander and including his brother Theseus, Charms professor Lally Hicks, wizard Yusuf Kama, and the courageous Muggle baker Jacob Kowalski. Grindelwald’s plan revolves around a rare, mystical creature called the Qilin, which has the ability to recognize a leader with a pure heart. By using dark magic to manipulate the Qilin, Grindelwald intends to deceive the wizarding world into believing he is the rightful leader. Meanwhile, Credence Barebone struggles with the revelation that he is Aurelius Dumbledore, a lost member of the Dumbledore family, and wrestles with his loyalty to Grindelwald. As Dumbledore and his team navigate danger, betrayals, and magical battles, they manage to expose Grindelwald’s deception at the election in Bhutan. With the truth revealed, Grindelwald’s power weakens, and in a climactic moment, Dumbledore’s blood pact is finally broken, allowing him to prepare for an inevitable showdown with his former friend.</p>
