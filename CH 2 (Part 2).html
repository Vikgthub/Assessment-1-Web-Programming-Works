        <h1>Cast</h1>
        <p> Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore features a rich cast of characters, each playing a crucial role in the battle between good and evil. The film brings back familiar faces while introducing new ones, deepening the connections between the Fantastic Beasts saga and the Harry Potter universe.

            Main Characters:
            Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) – One of the most powerful wizards of his time, Dumbledore is a brilliant but conflicted man bound by a blood pact that prevents him from directly confronting Grindelwald. He must rely on his allies to stop the dark wizard’s rise to power while facing personal struggles, including his complicated past with Grindelwald and his newfound family ties to Credence.
            Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) – A kind-hearted Magizoologist and the main protagonist of the Fantastic Beasts series. Newt's love for magical creatures and his deep sense of loyalty to Dumbledore lead him into dangerous missions, including protecting the rare Qilin and helping to outmaneuver Grindelwald’s forces.
            Gellert Grindelwald (Mads Mikkelsen) – The film’s main antagonist, Grindelwald is a powerful dark wizard with a dangerous vision of a world ruled by wizards. He manipulates public opinion, uses deception, and even employs dark magic to achieve his goals. Unlike Voldemort, he is more strategic and charismatic, making him an even greater threat.
            Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) – A Muggle (or No-Maj) baker who finds himself once again caught in the magical world. Despite lacking magical abilities, Jacob proves to be a courageous and essential member of Dumbledore’s team, even receiving a wand as a symbolic gesture of trust.
            Theseus Scamander (Callum Turner) – Newt’s older brother and a high-ranking Auror. He is brave, strong, and more serious than Newt, but he finds himself in grave danger when captured and thrown into a dark wizard prison.
            Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol) – A powerful Legilimens (mind-reader) who previously joined Grindelwald, believing his vision would allow her to be with Jacob. However, she begins to realize the truth about his dark intentions.
            Eulalie "Lally" Hicks (Jessica Williams) – A Charms professor at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in America. She is a skilled duelist and a valuable member of Dumbledore’s team.
            Yusuf Kama (William Nadylam) – A French wizard with a personal history of loss and suffering due to Grindelwald’s actions. He infiltrates Grindelwald’s circle to spy on him, but his loyalty is tested.
            Credence Barebone / Aurelius Dumbledore (Ezra Miller) – A troubled young wizard manipulated by Grindelwald. He learns that he is actually Aurelius Dumbledore, Albus’s long-lost relative, which leaves him emotionally conflicted and desperate for belonging.
            
            Supporting Characters:
            Aberforth Dumbledore (Richard Coyle) – Albus Dumbledore’s brother, who plays a crucial role in helping Credence understand his true heritage.
            Vicência Santos (Maria Fernanda Cândido) – A Brazilian witch who competes against Grindelwald in the election for Supreme Mugwump (the leader of the International Confederation of Wizards).
            Helmut (Aleksandr Kuznetsov) – A German wizard who serves as a loyal follower of Grindelwald.
